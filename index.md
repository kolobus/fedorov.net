Hi! My name is Mihail «Kolo» Fedorov, and I'm typical nerd: security specialist, systems administrator, developer operations engineer, PHP developer, cryptocurrency addict. This is my very own place for things, which I want to share. Someday it will be filled with useful information, manuals, my ideas, projects and random cute cat pictures.

Cat owner: scottish fold, [Pixel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2559459/57902173-b92e4b80-7870-11e9-82e2-aa8ed27cbcbd.jpg)
