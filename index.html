    <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Mihail &laquo;Kolo&raquo; Fedorov</strong>, and I'm typical nerd: security specialist, systems administrator, developer operations engineer, PHP developer, cryptocurrency addict. This is my very own place for things, which I want to share. Someday it will be filled with useful information, manuals, my ideas, projects and random cute cat pictures, but now it's mostly empty.</p>
